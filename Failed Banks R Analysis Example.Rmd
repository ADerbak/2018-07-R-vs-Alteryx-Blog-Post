In this example, I will demonstrate some quick usage of the R Markdown language to analyze the [FDIC Failed Bank List](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/fdic-failed-bank-list). This analysis will only scratch the surface of R, but it does take some time to build.. 

#Intro
First, let's take a quick look at the data:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
setwd("~/Fuzzy Logic/Workflow Examples/2018-07-26")

```


```{r error=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
banklist <- read.csv("banklist.csv", header = TRUE)
banklist_df <- data.frame(banklist)
head(banklist_df, 20)
count(banklist_df)
```

#Relevancy
We can get a good idea of what all is going on by just the first twenty rows out of 500+ rows of data. But how relevant is the data?

```{r, comment="##"}
# We can see the last time the data was updated...
banklist_df$Updated.Date <- as.Date(banklist_df$Updated.Date, format = "%d-%b-%y")
## Max Data Update Date
max(sort(banklist_df$Updated.Date, decreasing = TRUE))

#...And do the same for the last closing date
banklist_df$Closing.Date <- as.Date(banklist_df$Closing.Date, format = "%d-%b-%y")
## Last Failed Bank Close Date
max(sort(banklist_df$Closing.Date, decreasing = TRUE))
```

#Analysis
So the data has been maintained pretty recently and the last bank closing listed was December of 2017. Not too terrible. Lastly, I'll show a quick plot of the number of failed banks by state:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
colnames(banklist_df)
State_counts <- banklist_df %>%
  group_by(ST) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))
State_counts
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Top10 <- head(State_counts, 10)
p <- ggplot(Top10, aes(y=Top10$count, x=ST, fill=ST)) + 
    geom_col() +
  ylab("Count of Failed Banks")+
  xlab("States")
  
p + 
  labs(title = "Top 10 Failed Banks by State") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

All of this code was written rather hastily in under an hour. Again, I am only scratching the surface of what is possible, but it does take a bit of understanding in R to make this. Someone who uses R frequently could probably mock this up in under 10 minutes, but I'll admit it took me a good 20 as I have to remember certain functions and their arguments.
